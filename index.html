<p> I am an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.eas.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/nathan-vedal/">Department of East Asian Studies</a> at the University of Toronto, specializing in the intellectual, literary, and cultural history of late imperial China and early modern East Asia. I am currently working on two larger projects: one on Manchu intellectual and literary culture, and one on early modern encyclopedism. This website contains information on my <a href="https://nathanvedal.github.io/research/"> publications and latest research</a>, as well as <a href="https://nathanvedal.github.io/teaching/">teaching</a>.
